This application is a preliminary study using [React](https://reactjs.org/), so it may contain some errors. Feel free to comment, leave your code review, ask something or any contribution, it will be a pleasure receive them. I hope that you enjoy. :metal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eduk29/crud-react.git

## Start Application

1 - You need to start the JSON server to get access to a fake API. So open a terminal in your project root directory and run the following instruction:
```bash 
json-server --watch db.json
```
**This command terminal must be open during all application execution.**

2 - After the start of JSON server, you need to start the application. So open another command terminal in your project root directory and run the following instruction:
```bash
npm start
```
3 - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view application in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits in code.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
